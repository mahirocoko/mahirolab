# Audience Analysis

**Created:** 2025-10-22
**Purpose:** Define information needs for each audience segment

---

## Audience Segments

### 1. Developers (Technical Audience)
**Background:**
- Familiar with CLI tools, development workflows
- Understand git, bash scripting, programming concepts
- Looking for technical implementation details

**What They Need:**
- How the architecture works (orchestrator/worker pattern)
- Code examples and CLI commands
- Technical details of Codex integration
- Best practices for reasoning levels
- Debugging and monitoring techniques
- Safety considerations

**What They Want to Know:**
- Can I integrate this into my workflow?
- How do I customize/extend it?
- What are the limitations?
- Performance characteristics and resource usage

**Delivery Style:**
- Show code, don't just talk about it
- Live demos are crucial
- Technical diagrams with implementation details
- Real terminal output and file structures

---

### 2. Managers (Decision Makers)
**Background:**
- May or may not be technical
- Care about team productivity and ROI
- Concerned with adoption barriers and risks

**What They Need:**
- Business value proposition
- Time/cost savings metrics
- Team adoption feasibility
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Success stories and use cases

**What They Want to Know:**
- Will this improve team velocity?
- What's the learning curve?
- Is it safe for production use?
- What's the total cost of ownership?

**Delivery Style:**
- Start with outcomes, not implementation
- Use metrics and comparisons (before/after)
- Address concerns proactively (security, reliability)
- Show real-world impact examples

---

### 3. General Audience (Curious Learners)
**Background:**
- Variable technical background
- Interested in AI-assisted development trends
- May want to understand concepts without deep implementation

**What They Need:**
- High-level concept explanation
- Analogies and visual aids
- Avoid heavy jargon
- Clear mental models

**What They Want to Know:**
- What is this and why does it matter?
- How is this different from just using ChatGPT?
- Can I try this myself?
- Where is AI-assisted development heading?

**Delivery Style:**
- Start simple, layer in complexity
- Use analogies (orchestrator = conductor, workers = musicians)
- Visual diagrams over code
- Interactive demos they can follow along

---

## Information Layering Strategy

### Layer 1: Universal (All Audiences) - 15 minutes
- What problem does mahiro-lab solve?
- High-level architecture overview
- Core concepts (orchestrator, workers, state management)
- One compelling demo

### Layer 2: Practical (Developers + Managers) - 20 minutes
- Detailed use cases with metrics
- Workflow patterns
- Shortcode protocol demonstration
- Safety and best practices

### Layer 3: Technical Deep Dive (Developers) - 15 minutes
- Implementation details
- Customization and extension points
- Advanced features (parallel execution, reasoning levels)
- Troubleshooting and debugging

### Layer 4: Q&A (All Audiences) - 10 minutes
- Open questions
- Specific scenarios
- Next steps and resources

---

## Key Insights

**Common Ground:**
- All audiences care about practical value
- Everyone appreciates seeing it work (live demo)
- Clear documentation matters to everyone

**Divergence Points:**
- Developers want depth, managers want breadth
- Technical details energize developers, may lose general audience
- Managers need business case, developers need implementation details

**Success Criteria:**
- Developers leave wanting to try it immediately
- Managers understand ROI and can advocate for adoption
- General audience grasps the concept and sees the potential

---

## Presentation Approach

**Opening (Universal):**
- Problem statement everyone relates to
- "The current state of development workflow"
- Promise: "What if AI could handle the tedious parts?"

**Middle (Layered):**
- Start visual and high-level
- Progressively add technical depth
- Mark "Technical Detail" sections clearly
- Use callout boxes: "For Developers:" / "Business Impact:"

**Closing (Actionable):**
- Developers: How to get started today
- Managers: Next steps for team adoption
- General: Resources to learn more

**Output:** This analysis will inform presentation structure design (Task 1.2)
