# Claude Shortcode Protocol

Communication protocol between User and Claude for collaborative work through Codex Architecture.

---

## Core Shortcodes

### `ccc` - Create Context & Compact

**Purpose:** Summarize current conversation with session continuity support

**Claude Action:**
1. Check for existing context in `.mahirolab/state/context.md`
2. If context exists:
   - Prompt user: "Continue from previous session or Start fresh?"
   - **[1] Continue:** Show diff → Ask confirmation → Merge contexts
   - **[2] Fresh:** Archive old context → Create new one
3. Create versioned copy in `.mahirolab/state/context_history/context_vN_YYYYMMDD.md`
4. Update `.mahirolab/state/context.md` with current/merged context
5. Display summary to user

**Session Continuity:**
- Every `ccc` execution creates a new version in `context_history/`
- Version format: `context_vN_YYYYMMDD.md` (N = sequential number)
- "Continue" mode merges old goals, tasks, decisions with new information
- "Fresh" mode archives old context completely but keeps it accessible
- All changes logged to `execution_log.md`

**Output Format:**
```markdown
# Session Context

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Session ID:** [timestamp]

## Goals
- [Main objective 1]
- [Main objective 2]

## Completed
- ✅ [Task 1]
- ✅ [Task 2]

## Decisions Made
- [Key decision 1 + rationale]
- [Key decision 2 + rationale]

## Current Status
[Brief status update]

## Next Steps
- [ ] [Next task 1]
- [ ] [Next task 2]

## Blockers/Issues
- [Any blockers or concerns]
```

**When to Use:**
- Starting a new session
- Before creating a plan
- When conversation becomes too long
- Before switching context to another topic

---

### `nnn` - Smart Planning

**Purpose:** Create a detailed implementation plan

**Claude Action:**
1. Check if recent context exists (age < 1 hour)
   - If missing or outdated → run `ccc` automatically first
2. Read `.mahirolab/state/context.md` and latest context version from `context_history/`
3. Create detailed plan: `.mahirolab/state/plans/plan_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`
4. Reference context version in plan header
5. Check prerequisites from context
6. Display plan overview

**New Behavior:**
- Plans saved to `.mahirolab/state/plans/` (not root state/)
- Plan includes reference to context version used
- Prerequisites checked against context
- Supports new directory structure

**Output Format:**
```markdown

### `gogogo` - Execute Plan

**Purpose:** Start executing the most recent plan with real-time progress tracking

**Claude Action:**
1. Read the latest plan from `.mahirolab/state/plans/`
2. Initialize `.mahirolab/state/progress.md` with plan structure
3. Ask for confirmation before starting (unless user says to skip)
4. Execute tasks step by step:
   - Mark task as 🔄 In Progress with start timestamp
   - Display current task and step being worked on
   - Update "Current step" during execution
   - On completion: Mark ✅, record end timestamp, calculate duration
   - On failure: Mark ❌, log error, add to blockers, STOP execution
5. Update progress bars after each task
6. Calculate ETA based on completed tasks
7. Report after each phase completes
8. Update `execution_log.md` with detailed timeline

**Real-Time Progress Tracking:**
- Updates `progress.md` continuously with timestamps
- Shows progress bars: `[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 40% (6/15 tasks)`
- Displays ETA based on average task duration
- Logs every significant action to `execution_log.md`
- Status emojis: 🔄 In Progress, ✅ Completed, ⏳ Pending, ❌ Failed

**Execution Behavior:**
- **Sequential by default:** Execute tasks one at a time in order
- **Stop on error:** Halt if error encountered, wait for user to fix
- **Progress tracking:** Real-time updates to progress.md
- **Logging:** Detailed timeline in execution_log.md

**When to Use:**

## Codex Integration Shortcodes

### `rrresearch` - Claude-Managed Research

**Purpose:** Run codex research with Claude supervision and monitoring

**Claude Action:**
1. Accept research topic from user (format: `rrresearch "topic"`)
2. Prepare research prompt with template injection from `.mahirolab/templates/research-report.md`
3. Execute using Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`:
   ```bash
   codex exec -s danger-full-access \
     -c tools.web_search=true \
     -c model_reasoning_effort="medium" \
     "[research prompt with template]"
   ```
4. Store bash_id for monitoring
5. Notify user with job ID
6. User can check progress anytime with status updates

**Parameters:**
- **Topic:** Research subject (required)
- **Reasoning:** Always `medium` (fixed)
- **Web Search:** Always enabled

**Output:**
- File: `.mahirolab/research/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_PLACEHOLDER_codex_{topic}.md`
- Codex will replace PLACEHOLDER with its process ID
- Template-based structured markdown report

**Monitoring:**
```
User: Check research status
Claude: [Uses BashOutput tool to show progress]
```

**When to Use:**
- Need latest information from web
- Want Claude to monitor research progress
- Research task expected to take > 2 minutes
- Want ability to check status during execution

**Example:**
```
User: rrresearch "React 19 new features"
Claude: 🔍 Starting research job...
        Job ID: bash_12345
        Topic: React 19 new features
        Output: .mahirolab/research/20251022_141234_PLACEHOLDER_codex_react_19_new_features.md

        ✅ Job running in background
        Use "check status" to monitor progress
```

### `www` - Claude-Managed Worker

**Purpose:** Run codex background worker with Claude supervision

**Claude Action:**
1. Accept task description and optional parameters (format: `www [reasoning] "task"`)
2. Parse parameters:
   - Reasoning level (default: `low`)
   - Output type (default: `workers`)
   - Task description (required)
3. Prepare worker prompt with template injection from `.mahirolab/templates/worker-task.md`
4. Execute using Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`:
   ```bash
   codex exec -s danger-full-access \
     -c model_reasoning_effort="{reasoning}" \
     "[worker prompt with template]"
   ```
5. Store bash_id for monitoring
6. Notify user with job ID
7. User can check progress anytime

**Parameters:**
- **Reasoning:** minimal | low | medium | high (default: `low`)
- **Output Type:** workers | research | custom (default: `workers`)
- **Task:** Task description (required)

**Output:**
- File: `.mahirolab/{output_type}/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_TEMP_codex_task.md`
- Will be renamed to include bash PID when complete
- Template-based task report

**Usage Patterns:**
```
www "task description"                    # low reasoning, workers output
www medium "task description"             # medium reasoning, workers output
www high workers "complex refactoring"    # high reasoning, workers output
```

**Monitoring:**
```
User: Check worker status
Claude: [Uses BashOutput tool to show progress]
```

**When to Use:**
- Long-running tasks (refactoring, analysis)
- Want Claude to monitor worker progress
- Need different reasoning levels for different tasks
- Want ability to check status during execution

**Example:**
```
User: www high "Refactor authentication system"
Claude: 🚀 Starting worker job...
        Job ID: bash_12346
        Reasoning: high
        Task: Refactor authentication system
        Output: .mahirolab/workers/20251022_141500_TEMP_codex_task.md

        ✅ Job running in background
        Use "check status" to monitor progress
```

---

### Monitoring Background Jobs

**Check Status:**
```
User: Check [research/worker] status
User: Show job status
User: What's running?
```

**Claude Actions:**
- Use `BashOutput` tool with stored bash_id
- Display current progress and output
- Show completion status
- Provide file path when complete

**Stop Job:**
```
User: Stop [research/worker]
User: Cancel job
```

**Claude Actions:**
- Use `KillShell` tool with bash_id
- Confirm termination
- Report final status

        ├── context_metrics.json
        └── session_metrics.json
```

### File Lifecycle
1. **context.md** - Refreshed when running `ccc`, creates version in `context_history/`
2. **context_history/** - Permanent versioned snapshots, never deleted
3. **plans/*.md** - Created by `nnn`, executed by `gogogo`
4. **progress.md** - Initialized and updated during `gogogo` execution with real-time status
5. **execution_log.md** - Appended during execution with detailed timeline
6. **retrospectives/*.md** - Created by `rrr` with comprehensive session summary
7. **archive/** - Old files moved here, manual cleanup only (no auto-delete)

### Session Continuity Features
- **Context Versioning:** Every `ccc` creates a new version
- **Continue vs. Fresh:** Choose to merge with previous session or start clean
- **Progress Bars:** Visual task completion tracking
- **Timeline View:** See sessions from last 7 days in `lll`
- **Archive Policy:** All data preserved, no automatic deletion

## Usage Guidelines

### Typical Workflow

```
Session Start:
  User: lll                    # Check status
  Claude: [shows dashboard]

  User: ccc                    # Create context
  Claude: [creates context.md, shows summary]

  User: nnn                    # Create plan
  Claude: [creates plan, shows overview]

  User: gogogo                 # Execute
  Claude: [executes step-by-step]

Session End:
  User: rrr                    # Retrospective
  Claude: [creates retrospective]
```

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Run `ccc` when starting new session
- Run `lll` frequently to check progress
- Run `rrr` when completing major work
- Review plan before `gogogo`

❌ **Don't:**
- Don't `gogogo` without a plan
- Don't forget `ccc` and lose context
- Don't skip retrospective (lose learning opportunities)

---

## Integration with Codex Architecture

Shortcodes work together with Codex scripts:

- `ccc`, `nnn`, `rrr`, `lll` → **Pure Claude actions** (no codex invocation)
- `gogogo` → **May invoke Codex scripts** based on plan
  - Example: if task specifies `codex-exec.sh`, Claude will invoke it via Bash tool

---

## Future Shortcodes (Reserved)

Reserved for future use:

- `qqq` - Quick questions/clarifications
- `sss` - Show architecture/system summary
- `ddd` - Deep dive analysis
- `xxx` - Exit/wrap up session cleanly
- `ttt` - Run tests and validate
- `fff` - Fix/troubleshoot issues

---

## Notes for Claude

When encountering shortcode in conversation:

1. **No confirmation needed** - Execute immediately
2. **Follow specified format** - For consistency
3. **Save files in .mahirolab/state/** - Per specification
4. **Show brief summary** - No verbose output
5. **If issues arise** - Report and wait for instructions
